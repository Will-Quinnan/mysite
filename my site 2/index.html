        <P>My name is Will Quinnan until recently I was an  <i>aviantion communication electronics technision</i> for the <b>marine corps</b> working as the detatchments maintinance cheif. My job was to set up, maintain, update, repair, and operate various comumunication equipment such as radios, computers, servers, and layer 3 switches. In the last two years I was also in charging of reporting and ensuring maintinace on all of our maintinace needs were conducted for all of our equipment including our trucks trailers and ECUs<sup>(enviormental control unit)</sup>. Unfortantely due to some injuries I got while serving I can no longer meet the physical requirments needed to work as a technision. I already had some knowledge working with computers and because of this I decided to enroll in this coding course so that I would still be able to use some of the expeiriance I had while working a job that wasn't so physically demanding.

         <p>My hobbies outside of work used to including hiking, swimming, woodwork, cooking and various DIY<sup>(do it yourself)</sup> projects. Unfortantely due to my mobility issues I can't do many of the things I used to so nowadays my hobbies are mostly just playing video games, D&D, and various boardgames.
